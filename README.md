# Template React Native

The React Native Template is a pre-configured structure designed for quickly starting React Native projects. Developed with a dedicated focus on best software engineering practices, this template provides a robust foundation for efficient and modern mobile app development.


### Technologies
- [React Native ](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Expo (Expo Bearer Workflow)](https://expo.io/)
- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

### Getting started

```bash

# Cloning repository
git clone git@github.com:bitwise-technology/frontend-reactnative.git

# To install the necessary dependencies, use the following commands:

# To launch the application, use the following commands:
expo start or expo run:android
```

### Project Structure

The project is structured to enhance maintainability and scalability. Below is a simplified breakdown of the primary directories:

- **`src`**: The root directory containing the entire source code.

  - **`modules`**: This directory houses individual feature modules.

  - **`repositories`**: Repositories related to the module.

  - **`providers`**: Providers or external integrations specific to the module.

  - **`services`**: Services specific to the module.

  - **`router`**: Navigation-related configurations for the module.

  - **`shared`**: Contains shared components, utilities, and services that can be reused across different modules.

This streamlined structure aims to facilitate development by making it easy to locate and manage different aspects of the application. Adjust and expand this structure as needed for your project.
